My main area is Electrical, Electronics and Communication related subjects which are in my current course. Apart from curriculam, I have basic idea in Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms. Basics of Machine Learning. 

## ✨ Projects

Here are my projects:

* ### [Single Cycle processor](https://github.com/uma899/SingleCycle_RISCV_processor)

  This project helps to understand basic building blocks of a real world processer used in modern computers. This is a very basic version.
  *Technologies used:* `verilog`


## 🤝 How to Reach Me / Connect

I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or just chatting about tech.

## 💬 Interests

I am also intrested in web and app development. I do small (really small) projects. I just know basics of web dev like HTML, CSS and JS. Apart from them, I know using JS framework, react and express. I have also experimented with django and flask. I rely on MongoDB, MySQL for databases (just know what they are :) ). 
Here are few of them:
* [Blogger](https://uma899.github.io/blogWeb/)  - It takes time to load as I used onrender to deploy backend - [view project](https://github.com/uma899/blogWeb.git)
