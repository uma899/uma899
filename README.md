# üëã Hi there! I'm Mahesh!

I'm a student at IIT Tirupati, currently B.Tech third year in Electrical Engineering (EE). I am passinate about domains where there is intersection of Software and Hardware concepts.

## üöÄ What I'm Currently Learning

* Currently aiming about exploring different areas of my core branch.
* Trying to understand concepts of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.

## üå± My Skills & Technologies

Here are some of the tools and technologies I am familiar with:

**Languages:**

Verilog HDL, MATLAB, C/C++, python, javascript

**Tools:**
ModelSim, Vivado, LTspice, LabVIEW, TINA


## üí° What I know

My main area is Electrical, Electronics and Communication related subjects which are in my current course. Apart from curriculam, I have basic idea in Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms. Basics of Machine Learning. 

## ‚ú® Projects

Here are my projects:

* ### [Single Cycle processor](https://github.com/uma899/SingleCycle_RISCV_processor)

  This project helps to understand basic building blocks of a real world processer used in modern computers. This is a very basic version.
  *Technologies used:* `verilog`


## ü§ù How to Reach Me / Connect

I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or just chatting about tech.

* **Email:** [koyalada2006@gmail.com](mailto:koyalada2006@gmail.com)



## üí¨ Interests

I am also intrested in web and app development. I do small (really small) projects. I just know basics of web dev like HTML, CSS and JS. Apart from them, I know using JS framework, react and express. I have also experimented with django and flask. I rely on MongoDB, MySQL for databases (just know what they are :) ). For app dev, I know 'what is' React Native. I also did experiments like just using webview to build a react website into apk with android studio, and then giving access to native feature, like location, and use it in website.

Here are few things I've done:
* [Blogger](https://uma899.github.io/blogWeb/)  - It takes time to load as I used onrender to deploy backend - [view project](https://github.com/uma899/blogWeb.git)
* [Timer](https://uma899.github.io/timer/) - [view project](https://github.com/uma899/timer.git)

## Other Things
Sometimes, I also do different things like:
* [Imageeditor!](https://github.com/uma899/ImageEditor.git) and [AudioEditor](https://github.com/uma899/AudioEditor.git)
* [Some basic python use cases](https://github.com/uma899/py_proj.git)
* I also love to do photoediting and videoediting even though i don't have notable works :)
