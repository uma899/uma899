# 👋 Hi there! I'm Mahesh!

I'm a student at IIT Tirupati, currently B.Tech third year in Electrical Engineering (EE). I am passionate about domains where there is intersection of Software and Hardware concepts.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Learning

* Currently aiming about exploring different areas of my core branch.
* Trying to understand concepts of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.

## 🌱 My Skills & Technologies

Here are some of the tools and technologies I am familiar with:

**Languages:**

Verilog HDL, MATLAB, C/C++, python, javascript

**Tools:**
ModelSim, Vivado, LTspice, LabVIEW, TINA


## 💡 What I know

My main area is Electrical, Electronics and Communication related subjects which are in my current course. Apart from curriculam, I have basic idea in Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms, Shell scripting. Basics of Machine Learning. 

### Core courses:
*  Electrical Circuits and Networks
*  Digital Systems
*  Semiconductor Devices
*  Analog Circuits
*  Digital Signal Processing
*  Communication Systems
*  Electromagnetics
*  Control Systems
*  Electronic Instrumentation and Measurement

### Others:
* Maths: Linear algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Numerical Methods

## ✨ Projects

Here are my projects:

* ### [Single Cycle processor](https://github.com/uma899/SingleCycle_RISCV_processor)

  This project helps to understand basic building blocks of a real world processer used in modern computers. This is a very basic version.
  *Technologies used:* `verilog`

* ### [Pipelined Multiplier](https://github.com/uma899/32_bit_pipelined_mul)

  This aims to make a pipelined multiplier with fixed number of bits (32 bit). It can be further used in accelerators, DSP chips etc.
  *Technologies used:* `verilog`,  `vivado `

## 💬 Interests

I am also intrested in web and app development. I do small (really small) projects. I just know basics of web dev like HTML, CSS and JS. Apart from them, I know using JS framework, react and express. I have also experimented with django and flask. I rely on MongoDB, MySQL for databases (just know what they are :) ). For app dev, I know 'what is' React Native.

## Other Things
Sometimes, I also do different things like:
* [Imageeditor!](https://github.com/uma899/ImageEditor.git) and [AudioEditor](https://github.com/uma899/AudioEditor.git)
* [Some basic python use cases](https://github.com/uma899/py_proj.git)
* I also love to do photoediting and videoediting even though i don't have notable works.
